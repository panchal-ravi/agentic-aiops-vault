# Specification Quality Checklist: HashiCorp Vault PKI MCP Tools

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 22 October 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- ✅ Specification contains no implementation details about programming languages, frameworks, or specific APIs
- ✅ Focuses on user value (certificate management, security auditing, compliance verification)
- ✅ Written in business language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in the specification
- ✅ All requirements (FR-001 through FR-014) are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) include specific metrics (time, accuracy percentages)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of implementation technologies)
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios defined for both user stories with clear Given-When-Then format
- ✅ Comprehensive edge cases identified (8 scenarios covering permissions, orphaned certs, multi-level chains, etc.)
- ✅ Scope is clearly bounded to two tool functions: list PKI engines and list certificates
- ✅ Dependencies identified (Vault authentication, token, namespace configuration)

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- ✅ Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✅ User scenarios cover both primary flows (list engines, view certificates)
- ✅ Measurable outcomes defined with specific metrics and accuracy requirements
- ✅ No implementation details present (no mention of Python, FastAPI, hvac library, etc.)

## Notes

✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification has passed all quality validation checks:
- Complete coverage of user needs without prescribing technical solutions
- Clear, testable requirements with measurable success criteria
- Comprehensive edge case analysis for robust implementation planning
- Well-defined entity model providing context for data relationships
- Technology-agnostic success criteria focusing on user experience and accuracy

The specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.
