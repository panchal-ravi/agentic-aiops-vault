# Feature Specification: AWS CloudWatch Logs Filter MCP Tool

**Feature Branch**: `002-cloudwatch-logs-filter`  
**Created**: 22 October 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "implement a MCP tool to filter AWS cloudwatch logstream events"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Log Event Filtering (Priority: P1)

A user needs to search through CloudWatch log streams to find specific log events matching text patterns, time ranges, or log levels. They want to quickly locate relevant events without manually scrolling through thousands of log entries.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers immediate value by solving the primary use case of log analysis and troubleshooting.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by connecting to a CloudWatch log stream, applying a simple text filter, and receiving filtered results, delivering immediate log search value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a CloudWatch log stream with mixed log events, **When** user applies a text filter for "ERROR", **Then** only log events containing "ERROR" are returned
2. **Given** a log stream with events across multiple days, **When** user specifies a time range filter, **Then** only events within that time range are returned
3. **Given** a log stream with various log levels, **When** user filters by log level "WARN", **Then** only warning-level events are displayed

### User Story 2 - Advanced Pattern Matching (Priority: P2)

A user wants to use regular expressions and complex pattern matching to find sophisticated patterns in log events, such as IP addresses, error codes, or specific JSON field values.

**Why this priority**: Extends basic filtering with powerful pattern matching capabilities that are essential for advanced log analysis and debugging.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by applying regex patterns to log events and verifying pattern matches work correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** log events containing IP addresses, **When** user applies an IP address regex pattern, **Then** events matching the IP pattern are returned
2. **Given** JSON-formatted log events, **When** user filters by a specific JSON field value, **Then** events with matching field values are displayed

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-Stream Filtering (Priority: P3)

A user needs to search across multiple CloudWatch log streams simultaneously to correlate events across different services or applications.

**Why this priority**: Provides advanced correlation capabilities that are valuable for complex system debugging but not essential for basic use cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by applying filters across multiple log streams and verifying results are aggregated correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple log streams from related services, **When** user applies a filter across all streams, **Then** matching events from all streams are returned with stream identification
2. **Given** different log streams with varying formats, **When** user applies a common filter pattern, **Then** events matching the pattern from each stream are properly identified

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a log stream is empty or has no events matching the filter criteria?
- How does the system handle very large log streams with millions of events?
- What occurs when AWS API rate limits are reached during log retrieval?
- How does the system respond when AWS credentials are invalid or expired?
- What happens when the specified log stream or log group doesn't exist?
- How does filtering behave with malformed or corrupted log entries?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST connect to AWS CloudWatch Logs using AWS credentials
- **FR-002**: System MUST retrieve log events from specified CloudWatch log streams
- **FR-003**: System MUST filter log events based on text pattern matching
- **FR-004**: System MUST filter log events based on time range criteria
- **FR-005**: System MUST support log level filtering (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
- **FR-006**: System MUST support regular expression pattern matching for advanced filtering
- **FR-007**: System MUST return filtered results in a structured, readable format
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle pagination for large result sets
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide error handling for invalid filters or AWS connectivity issues
- **FR-010**: System MUST support filtering across multiple log streams
- **FR-011**: System MUST respect AWS API rate limits and implement appropriate throttling
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate filter parameters before executing queries

### Key Entities

- **Log Event**: Individual log entry with timestamp, message content, log level, and metadata
- **Log Stream**: Collection of log events from a specific source, identified by log group and stream name
- **Filter Criteria**: Parameters defining what events to include (patterns, time ranges, log levels)
- **Query Results**: Filtered collection of log events with metadata about the query execution

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can filter log events and receive results in under 10 seconds for streams with up to 10,000 events
- **SC-002**: System successfully filters log events with 99.9% accuracy for pattern matches
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully connect to and query any accessible CloudWatch log stream on first attempt
- **SC-004**: System handles concurrent filtering requests from multiple users without performance degradation
- **SC-005**: 95% of filter operations complete successfully without errors or timeouts

## Assumptions

- Users have valid AWS credentials with CloudWatch Logs read permissions
- Log streams follow standard CloudWatch Logs formatting conventions
- Users are familiar with basic regex patterns for advanced filtering
- AWS CloudWatch Logs API will remain stable and backwards compatible
- Log events are primarily text-based (JSON, plain text, structured logs)
